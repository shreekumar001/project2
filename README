Web crawler
————————————————————————————

For this project we have to solve the two main projects:
1. Login into the fake book and maintain the session ID from the server to keep the connection live throughout the web crawling process
2. Collect lists of friends from each friend of the home user and traverse through them neglecting the mutual friends (duplicate friends list) among all the users.
3. Catching the secret flag if present using regular expression while traversing through each page

High Level Approach:
————————————————————————————

Created the socket connection.

Retrieved the csrftoken and session-id from server response before login.

Used CSRF token, session ID to post the login details in the login page.

After server sends OK response collected the friend list of the user from the home page

Stored all the friends in a list and start traversing one by one

For the first friend (for ex: joe) in the list, joe’s friend list is collected and all the friends are appended to the existing list

First friend of joe is accessed and same process is repeated again

For each values stored in the list, before it is compared with the previous values to avoid any duplicate entries.

A separate search list is maintained to traverse all the unique friend list one by one

While traversing all the home and friend list pages of all the friends the secret flags are collected if found using regex pattern

All the internal server error are handled and connection is either continued or reset if requirements are met.

Shell script is written to execute the program and use valid arguments

Challenges:
———————————————————————————

Frequent disconnects from the server

Exchange of responses for given requests

302 found and 500 internal server error problems

loops

partially received html message responses
